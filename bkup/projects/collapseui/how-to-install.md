## How to install
---
To install **Collapse-UI**, You can install like regular minecraft's texture pack. if you don't know anyhow, here's an instructions.<br><br>
> **For Bedrock Edition**
- **[1]** Download the `.mcpack` version (Bedrock Resource format). If you encountered an issue where you got `.zip` instead, you can simply rename it to `.mcpack`
- **[2]** Import the `.mcpack` file to minecraft via **"Open with/as"**. For Android users, you can get `Zarchiver` from the playstore, and use the **square-arrow button** next to "Open" instead.
- **[3]** Minecraft will automatically launch itself and will immediately import it for you out of the gate, so you don't have to do anything with it.
- **[4]** Goto `Game Settings > Global Resource`, and select **Collapse-UI** and apply it.
- **[5]** Done! if you wish to go back to vanilla, you can do the opposite of (.4). instead of applying, you remove it.
> **Customizability**
- Refer to "Configuration" tab.
