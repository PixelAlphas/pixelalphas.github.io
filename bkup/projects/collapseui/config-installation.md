## How to install
---
Installing Config pack should be the same as Installation tab, but with extra steps for more way to store and use your own config pack.<br><br>
- **[1]** Before installing, change `.mcpack` to `.zip`, extract it.
- **[2]** Goto `Template-config > ui > _global_variables.json` with any text editor you have.
- **[3]** Modify any config from there.
- **[4]** If done, Go back to the folder where an extracted folder located, and compress it to `.zip` then rename it to `.mcpack` afterward.
- **[5]** If you wish to have multiple config packs, You can do (.2) but instead, `Template-config > manifest.json`. change the UUID and name as you desired.
- **[6]** If everything done, you can install it like how would you install texture pack or Collapse-ui in general.
