Normally it would be 7-10 days, but it may change depends on how much busy i am.

> **Will it be on marketplace someday...?**

Unfortunately, Devamped is non-profit project. practically speaking, I'm not making any money out of this. essentially, marketplace may cost some money to post and there's no guarantee that Devamped gonna be free. â€” The definitive answer is "No".

Life is sometimes hard and I've gotten busy every day. there's no denying that i went abit out of the board sometimes. and like I've stated. Devamped is my hobby, i don't really make anything out of it, and so on.
