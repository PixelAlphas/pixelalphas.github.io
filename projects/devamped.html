        <pi><pi class="bold">DEVAMPED</pi> is essentially a simplified <pi class="bold">bedrock edition</pi> texture pack, while at first it started as cartoon-ish/rpg style, along of progress it's changed into something new entirely. it was now reimagined vanilla having both cartoon-ish and retro-rpg style.</pi>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It was one of my <pi class="bold">hobby project</pi> that I thought might look cool despite most of my favorite texture packs out there are mainly focused on <pi class="bold">Java edition</pi>. which I can't really use them on bedrock without manually converting them. the converter is also don't work well.</p><br>
        <p>Hence, this project was born. This will not be on marketplace for that exact reason and will remain free like any texture packs out there.</p><br>
        <p>While this was fully made on mobile, developments may go vary. so, it may slow down or sometimes faster. it depends. The current pack percentage are <pi class="bold">35%</pi> completion, and will get updates by <pi class="bold">Daily - 3-5 days</pi> as usual, or maybe <pi class="bold">weekly</pi> in-case of update taking long or there's accidents. <i>(e.g accidentally deleting the whole assets that includes the update, or don't really have time to finish the update.)</i></p><br>
