## Compatibility
All in-game UI's are compatible, can be used on any addons that modifies gameplay elements at the same time not affecting Collapse-UI's modified screen.

However, this does not **compatible** anything that modified certain pre-game screens. i.e **"Client" packs, Gameplay Mod packs, or anything that overlays the screen with pause screen.**
