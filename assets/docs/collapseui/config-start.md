### Getting Started
First of all, "unzip" the file on your file manager; You can navigate the files, Go to `CollapseUI-Config_Template > ui` and you should see the file named `_global_variables.json`.
<br><br>
Copy that file, go outside from the `.zip` file and paste it there. or anywhere if you want as long it is not inside the `.zip` file.
<br><br>
From that, you can begin opening `_global_variables.json` file by using your **text editor**.
<br><br>
The file itself has alot of comments on it as you see `//` after text. this is a JSON comment, so usually if you have text editor that does have JSON vaildator, the editor might show red underline alot around these comments. Don't be alarmed, Comments does not effect anything unless you remove `//`, so you can safely ignore it.
<br><br>
There is a non-comment version which you can also grab from here, but it is just a `_global_variables.json` file so you'll have to replace that from the template.
