### Finishing and testing
After you finished modifying and tweaking into something you'd like. You can start apply by moving the `_global_variables.json` back inside the template's `.zip` file to where it was originally. ***You can now install it just like Collapse-UI!***
<br><br>
However, if you're not satisfied after the installation and changes you've made. No worries, Go to your `com.mojang` folder. Depends on system and platform you're using, look up the requirement.
<br><br>
From that, Go to `com.mojang/resource_pack`, find the Collapse-UI's config template folder, Go to the `ui` folder as usual but this time you don't have to move the file but instead. Directly modify them using your text editior.
<br><br>
After changes, **Relaunch the game and see the changes you've made. and that's it! you installed your own config and tweaked it your own, Have fun!**
