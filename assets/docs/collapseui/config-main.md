### Where to start?
> #### Note
> Configuration in ***All UI packs*** (Collapse-UI Included) are little fraglie and may cause crashes if done incorrectly. **Make a backup everytime you do changes!**

<br>To get started, Configuration works on ALL devices as long you can install them, just like installing Collapse-UI. to begin, you might wanna meet these requirements first or **otherwise you may face a difficulty.**
<br><br>
Don't worries, While configuration requires some learning curve. this guide will require none so it can be tweaked by everyone else.

> #### Requirements
> - **Text Editors** - Android, PC, iOS has one of those. It has to be usable text editor, not just some note apps!
>   - For Android, `Zarchiver` are recommended. It's a file manager, but has `.zip` support and text editor built-in.
>   - For Windows, `VSCode` are recommended and is optional, `Notepad` Works too and is also built-in in your system.
>   - For Linux, `VSCode` are recommended and is optional, Depends on your desktop environment, Some of them includes their own text editor, that works too. but i prefer `Kate` by KDE due to built-in JSON vaildator.
>   - For iOS, `Kodex` are recommended.
>   - For MacOS, I don't know if it has text editor though tbh lmao.
> - **File manager + Optionally with `.zip` Support** - You'll need this in order to navigate the template files and open them with **Text Editor**.
>   - For Android, `Zarchiver` are recommended. It has `.zip` support and is alot faster than any built-in file manager.
>   - For Linux/Windows/iOS/MacOS, System built-in file manager should do, as it already have `.zip` support.
> - **Know the Game's file path location** - This is essential as you will be modifying them directly, It's alot easier and does not require you uninstall the pack and reinstall them. - This is also very useful in your future installing add-ons, skin packs and resource pack endeavors. **Open your file manager and look them up by the path below!**
>   - Android: Google has closed the way to access unfortunately, you might wanna do uninstall and reinstall method instead :(
>   - Windows: `C:\Users\Harlow\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\Shared\games\com.mojang`
>   - Linux/MacOS: If you're playing on mcpelauncher, there's 2 path locations depends on where you install it from. and 1 path location if you're playing on MacOS.
>       - Regular: `~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang`
>       - Flatpak/Store: `/.var/app/io.mrarm.mcpelauncher/data/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang`
>       - MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mcpelauncher/games/com.mojang`
>   - iOS: Find `com.mojang` folder, shouldn't be far off.

<br>You can start grabbing the template file below here. It is a `.zip` file, you'll need a file manager to open it.
