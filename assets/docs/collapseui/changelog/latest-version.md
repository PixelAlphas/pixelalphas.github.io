- Optimized Settings screen, reduced by 20% loading time. However, may stutter in some cases.
- By default, **Playerlist tab will be disabled due to people request.**
- Better optimizations and reduced ton of codes.
- Buttons just got full rewrite, synced with legacy's button structure. therefore making both legacy (not animated) and current (animated) a same thing. I've also enchanced the button's animations too. but this comes a cost with certain elements being rewrote for this change.
- Controller changes:
  - The support of it has been extended due to button rewrite.
  - Anything that makes button goes out of bound should now no longer exist, but this comes a cost with visuals being degraded in some screens.
- Button's bubble text just got full rewrite too, this includes a new fading in and out animation and moving in expo easing.
- The rounded brackets in configuration menu from "About UI" are now gray instead of full white.
- All buttons with text bubbles has been updated.
- Animation adjustments and ported over to animation file.
- Due to several new workflow going on that i'm now using, All Collapse-UI's folders, files and assets will be moved to the new `Collapse-UI > '.arx-assets'` folder. **However, config customization's assets will remains unchanged for better accessibly.**
- Due to Ore-UI changes, certain screens like **Play screen (World creation screen), Death screen and IP (Add a new server) screen** will be removed from the pack.
- All theme should follow up the designed version.
- Chat screen's features such as Autocorrection, History message and Command selectors are removed on Controller and Keyboard/Mouse due to several issues, at the same time. these features were designed for the mobile users as Controller/K&M already have these features, so they're unaffected in this change.
- Hud statistics (Coords and Time played) will be temporarliy placed on top-right instead of bottom-right due to controller issue.
- Texture redraw to buttons and sliders.
- Settings toggles that has been toggled and dropdown toggles will have their background as accessibility.
- All icons are now white instead of gray-ish due to theme related.
- Scrolling backgrounds in the start button (will not be shown in this update due to "Classic Menu") should be corrected in terms of animations.
