> **What's new? —**
- Few New UI changes.
- Better optimizations and reduced ton of codes.

> **Changes —**
- Buttons just got full rewrite, synced with legacy's button structure. therefore making both legacy (not animated) and current (animated) a same thing. I've also enchanced the button's animations too. but this comes a cost with certain elements being rewrote for this change.
- Controller changes:
  - The support of it has been extended due to button rewrite.
  - Anything that makes button goes out of bound should now no longer exist, but this comes a cost with visuals being degraded in some screens.
- Button's bubble text just got full rewrite too, this includes a new fading in and out animation and moving in expo easing.
- The rounded brackets in configuration menu from "About UI" are now gray instead of full white.
- All buttons with text bubbles has been updated.
- Animation adjustments and ported over to animation file.
- **Starting now, all of UI files will be moved to it's new folder. However, UI textures is currently unaffected.**
