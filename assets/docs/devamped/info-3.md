## Marketplace...?
I'm not looking forward to put this texture pack on marketplace, well since this is hobby project that originally mock bedrock community about not having the original texture pack designed for it nor being free like any java edition's texture packs, i figured it'll be the best for being a free texture pack and will be maintained throughout the game's lifespain.

I also was approched by cubecraft's staff about putting Devamped on marketplace, but my mind was really different back then and is also devamped are like 20% finished. Hate to say that i had to refuse the offer. while this looks like a idiotic decision, This is just. honestly normal for me as i stick to what i promised - "will remain for free with no marketplace" motto.
<br><br>
Even after the offer refusal, It wouldn't make any differences anyway, due to how extremely complex of getting into marketplace are, and also how weird to just accept some NDA and let them took over the pack as this also will result Devamped no longer being a free public pack with only for "console support"

Sadly, my next texture pack may not be free or will be marketplace exclusive. but that will change if i can be marketplace partner myself as standalone. which will allow me to make the pack free, but updates after 1 weeks of the update released.
