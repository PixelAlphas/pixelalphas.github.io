Really big story, need to correct things for awhile. come back soon!

<!-- I am originally a minecraft server hoster back in 2018 for an app called **"Omlet Arcade"**, got myself about **50-60+ daily though BDS hosting.** It's a survival server with essential stuff.
<br><br>
Though. I did also host normal server for outside of **"Omlet Arcade"** for personal reasons and maintains the same playerbase aswell. However, this is a free server with no donation. so im running 2 servers out of my own pocket. so, **The server goes down after 1 year.**
<br><br>
Since then, ive started my other adventures and it's **Add-On**. weirdly enough, ive learned little of addon development related during my time with hosting server. so, i've joined a discord server called **"Bedrock Add-Ons"** looking for some finds and help about things i want to add. **I'm also pretty expert at commands back then too!**
<br><br>
Then i found out that there's data-driven UI exists on bedrock with just **.json files**, it's called **"JSON-UI"** (duh lmao) and ever since then, ive been trying to add my own UIs with a help from the community.
<br><br>
So i did create my youtube account afterward that has these old stuff that i made in the past, ever since that. I went head-on with making few JSON-UI packs and updates, then after the first UI pack i've made goes discontinued (Arcdustry-UI), **Devamped** was born and i'm really active on that texture pack for really long while back then.
<br><br>
After alot of Devamped updates, I got alot of requests about doing more update to that UI. so, I didn't do anything much but instead, **Collapse-UI** just exists.
<br><br>
I also did create a discord server during Devamped, it's a place where i could send a teaser and update logs. to this day, I'm active to my own discord server. There's probably more story behind this, but that's all i can remember for now. -->
