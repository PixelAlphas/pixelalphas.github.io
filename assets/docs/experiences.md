I am an artist during 2000, aswell a programmer who does BASIC, C++ and several.
<br><br>
Well, that was decades ago. though. ever since, I just... forgot how to do code stuff aswell properly drawing some arts.
<br><br>
Since minecraft made me do some arts alot, some of my memories were bought back and i'm slowly back at my old art days, then i just open some commissions, and there's that. Also i don't do commission anymore, so don't ask. - **Little fun fact: All of my profile icon are made by my own.**
<br><br>
I'm decent at making maps, also well expert at commands (mcfunction/CB). then recently well expert at JSON-UI (thanks to BAO folks) and there's that!
<br><br>
There's also a certain upcoming project that made me to do some music covers and learning new stuff. though, hopefully it will turn nicely done.
