Greetings, I'm Harlow! ( Aka Arxance/PixelAlphas )
<br><br>
My pronounce are usually **They/Them** as i'm Non-binary. Though i don't really mind being mispronounced and often time don't really interact with others.<br>
<br>
Most people usually call me as some library person as i do know alot of stuff and do alot of work as a freelancer, well. atleast no longer. My mental health isn't usually good but I can control myself through time like these. This comes a cost with me being more **talkative and has alot of short temper.** even though i'd kill myself for that. I'm usually a shy and does not message people often privately, only to people i know.
<br><br>
I'm Pixel/Digital artist, model animator, JSON-UI pack dev for a game called **Minecraft: Bedrock**. Also, im usually busy at most things including IRL stuff as i have work too.
<br><br>
I play quite alot certain games, but not often nowadays due to... well, job and busy at almost everything.
